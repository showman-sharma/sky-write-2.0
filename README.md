# sky-write-2.0
This project creates an environment to write in the air. No special pen/tools. Just a camera and the user's hand.

When the hand makes the posture of holding a pen, the ink starts getting printed. To choose/ change color, move your index finger towards the given colors. To clear the screen, move the index finger towards 'clear screen'
